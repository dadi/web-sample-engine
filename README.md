This repository serves as a starting point to develop a new engine interface for DADI Web.

# API

This section describes Web's Engine API, listing the properties and functions that engine interfaces are expected to expose.

### Metadata block

All engine interfaces must have a named export called `metadata`, which gives Web a preliminary round of information about the engine before anything else is loaded. This is important because engine interfaces are initialised *on demand*, which means that a given engine will only be started when/if a template requires it.

The `metadata` export must be an object with the following properties.

| Property     | Description                                                                      | Required |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| `extensions` | An array of file extensions supported by the engine (including the trailing dot) | **✓**    |
| `handle`     | A string uniquely identifying the template engine                                | **✓**    |
| `config`     | A config block to be appended to the global schema, as per [convict](https://github.com/mozilla/node-convict)'s format. If the `handle` is  `myEngine` and you add a config parameter of `myProperty`, its value in Web's configuration file should go in `engines.myEngine.myProperty`| **✗**    |

### Main block

The main export must be a factory function that returns a constructor for the engine. All `require()` calls **must happen inside this function**, so that dependencies are lazy-loaded and only instantiated if/when there is a template requiring this particular engine.

### Constructor

The engine constructor will be called with an `options` object, containing the following properties.

| Property              | Description                                                                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `additionalTemplates` | An array of absolute paths to any templates found with an extension supported by this engine that haven't already been loaded due to not having a JSON schema file (i.e. are not pages). This is used by engines that wish to actively load/compile partial templates. |
| `config`              | A reference to the global configuration object from core                         |
| `pagesPath`           | The absolute path to the directory containing pages/templates                    |
| `templates`           | A hash map containing all the templates that have been loaded                    |

### Functions

The object returned from the constructor should have the following functions in its prototype.

> #### `.finishLoading()`
> **Arguments:** N/A
>
> **Returns:** Function
>
> **Required:** ✗

This method is fired by the core after all pages have been loaded. It can be used by engines to perform clean-up operations or to load additional templates (e.g. partials).

---

> #### `.getCore()`
> **Arguments:** N/A
>
> **Returns:** Function
>
> **Required:** ✓

Must return a reference to the core module used by the template engine.

---


> #### `.getInfo()`
> **Arguments:** N/A
>
> **Returns:** Object
>
> **Required:** ✓

Must return an object containing information about the template engine, such as name and version.

---

> #### `.initialise()`
> **Arguments:** N/A
>
> **Returns:** Promise
>
> **Required:** ✓

This method is called when the core loads a page that requires this particular template engine. Because it can return a Promise, it can do any necessary asynchronous initialisation routines and resolve when finished.

---

> #### `.register()`
> **Arguments:**
> - `name`: The name of the template to be registered
> - `data`: The content (markup) of the template
> - `path`: The absolute path to the template file
>
> **Returns:** Promise
>
> **Required:** ✓

This method is called when the core reads the content of a page template and wishes to register it with the engine. This is a good place to compile templates into functions. It can return a Promise, so the compilation can happen asynchronously.


---

> #### `.render()`
> **Arguments:**
> - `name`: The name of the template to be rendered
> - `data`: The content (markup) of the template
> - `locals`: An object with data to be passed to the template
> - `options`: A list of options passed by the core. Currently, it only includes a `keepWhitespace` property, which engines may wish to implement, specifying whether or not whitespace in templates should be preserved.
>
> **Returns:** Promise
>
> **Required:** ✓

This method is called when a view wishes to render a template as HTML. Depending on how the engine interface is implemented, this could involve a compile step or simply loading a function from a cache. It returns a Promise, so asynchronous operations can be executed.

# Helper functions

A helpers file located in [`lib/helpers.js`](lib/helpers.js) provides a few file manipulation methods that developers might find useful when creating an engine interface. The signature and description for these functions is available in [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) format alongside the code.

# Unit tests

Engine adapters are responsible for testing their own functionality. This repository includes a test suite powered by [mocha](https://mochajs.org/), including [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) for mocking/stubbing and [html-looks-like](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-looks-like) for easier comparison of HTML output.

To run the tests, type `npm run test`.
